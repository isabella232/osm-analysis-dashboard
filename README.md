#### _Where is the map ready?_
Geographers know there is no such thing as a _complete_ map. In fact, a [truly _complete map_ does not make a lot of sense and would not be very useful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Exactitude_in_Science).

Instead we ask about _readiness_. This is a notion of ["fitness for purpose"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fit_for_purpose) for OSM data. Where is the map _ready to be used for routing_? _ready to be used for rendering a basemap_?

Using a combination of OSM datasets and open source OSM data processing tools, we create `mbtiles` tilesets of readiness statistics that can be explored and compared across a variety of dimensions with this interactive dashboard.
